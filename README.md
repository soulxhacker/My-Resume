My Resume, made with JavaScript

Hi guys, this is my single Resume I made with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and few other tools. You are free too use this as a template for creating your resume.
The resume can be navigated with navbar.
To view the resume, you will need to access it through my portfolio as github doesn't allow more than one pages.
